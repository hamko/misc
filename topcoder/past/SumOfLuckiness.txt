PROBLEM STATEMENT
Mr. Dengklek once told you that 4 and 7 are lucky numbers. He also defined the luckiness of a positive integer as the absolute difference between the number of 7s in its decimal representation and the number of 4s in its decimal representation. For example, for each of the numbers 23, 47 and 47714 the luckiness is 0, and for each of the numbers 4474 and 7070 the luckiness is 2.

You are given two ints A and B. Return the sum of luckiness of all integers between A and B, inclusive.
