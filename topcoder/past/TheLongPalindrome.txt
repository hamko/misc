PROBLEM STATEMENT

John and Brus are studying string theory at the university.  Their task is to create a list of all the palindromes that contain between 1 and n lowercase letters ('a'-'z'), inclusive.  A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.  Additionally, each palindrome in their list must contain no more than k distinct letters.  Return the number of palindromes in the list modulo 1234567891.


DEFINITION
Class:TheLongPalindrome
Method:count
Parameters:int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int count(int n, int k)


CONSTRAINTS
-n will be between 1 and 1,000,000,000, inclusive.
-k will be between 1 and 26, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
1
1

Returns: 26

All palindromes in the list are single character strings.

1)
2
10

Returns: 52

Now we have single and double character palindromes.

2)
3
2

Returns: 728

A slightly longer list.

3)
44
7

Returns: 240249781
