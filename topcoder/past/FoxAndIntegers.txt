PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fox Jiro and Eel Saburo are good friends. One day Jiro received a letter from Saburo. The letter contains four integers representing an encrypted message. Please help Jiro to decrypt the message.

You are given four ints: AminusB, BminusC, AplusB, and BplusC. Your task is to find three integers A, B, and C such that:

AminusB = A - B
BminusC = B - C
AplusB = A + B
BplusC = B + C

There is always at most one triplet of integers A, B, C that satisfies all four equalities.

If it exists, return a vector <int> with exactly three elements: { A, B, C }. If there are no such integers, return an empty vector <int> instead.


DEFINITION
Class:FoxAndIntegers
Method:get
Parameters:int, int, int, int
Returns:vector <int>
Method signature:vector <int> get(int AminusB, int BminusC, int AplusB, int BplusC)


CONSTRAINTS
-AminusB will be between -30 and 30, inclusive.
-BminusC will be between -30 and 30, inclusive.
-AplusB will be between -30 and 30, inclusive.
-BplusC will be between -30 and 30. inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
1
-2
3
4

Returns: {2, 1, 3 }

A - B = 2 - 1 = 1
B - C = 1 - 3 = -2
A + B = 2 + 1 = 3
B + C = 1 + 3 = 4

1)
0
0
5
5

Returns: { }

A = B = C = 2.5 satisfy all four equalities, but A, B, and C must all be integers.

2)
10
-23
-10
3

Returns: {0, -10, 13 }

A, B, and C may be negative or zero.

3)
-27
14
13
22

Returns: { }



4)
30
30
30
-30

Returns: {30, 0, -30 }
